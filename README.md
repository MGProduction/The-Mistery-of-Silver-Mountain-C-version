# The-Mistery-of-Silver-Mountain-C-version-
This is a C "translation" of *The Mystery of Silver Mountain* (1984), originally written in BASIC by **Chris Oxlade** and **Judy Tatchell** for **Usborne Publishing**.

```
          MYSTERY OF SILVER
              MOUNTAIN
========================================


GOOD LUCK ON YOUR QUEST!. YOU ARE AT A
CROSSROADS AND YOU CAN GO E,W,

========================================


WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW 
?
```

This version goes beyond a straightforward BASIC-to-C rewrite: it aims to enhance readability by "decrypting" the original code, which was intentionally obfuscatedâ€”both to save space and to avoid revealing spoilers to users typing it into their 8-bit machines. The goal is to make the code easier to understand and more accessible for future translations into other languages or platforms.

That said, this version remains as faithful as possible to the original game logic and structure. No changes have been made to the adventure content itself, except for avoiding the use of GOTO statements in favor of more structured code.

A PDF copy of the book is still available from Usborne's website here: https://usborne.com/gb/books/computer-and-coding-books.

## Why?

I'm working on a translation (adding graphics and some extra features) of this great adventure game in StoryTllr, and I needed a way to ensure that I don't miss some of the original features. Working MORE on the original code was then *mandatory*.

## References
I've decided to work on a C translation of the original source code after having seen the great work done by **Ben Holland** (https://github.com/fivegreenapples/go-mountain/tree/main) who did a **Golang** translation. I've worked with his code for a while (deobfuscating it) and I thought it was interesting doing the work of **C** code instead.
